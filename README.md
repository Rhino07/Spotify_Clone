## 🎵 Spotify Clone

This project is a **Spotify-inspired web application** currently focused on building a responsive and visually accurate **frontend UI** using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**. The goal of this project is to replicate the core design, layout, and user experience of Spotify’s web player.
Currently, the project includes only the homepage UI with no underlying functionality or backend integration.

🚀 **Future Enhancements**
The project will be extended into a **fully functional full-stack application**, including:

* Backend development for user authentication
* Music streaming functionality
* Playlist creation and management
* Database integration
* API-based data handling

This project is being actively developed to strengthen full-stack web development skills and demonstrate real-world application design.
